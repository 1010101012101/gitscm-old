  <h3 class="title">From git-scm.com Maintainer Scott Chacon</h3>
  <p>If everyone reading this donated a hundred and twelve dollars, our annual fundraiser would be over in just a few months.
  Not everyone can or will donate. And thatâ€™s fine, because each year just enough people support git-scm.com with a small donation. If you feel it's your turn, and you know it is, please make a small donation of $112, $227, $305 or whatever you can to keep git-scm.com free.</p>

  <p>Most people don't know this, but I'm a volunteer. A classy, classy volunteer.</p>

  <p>I don't get paid a cent for my work at git-scm.com, and neither do the thousands of Git project developers. The hosting of this incredibly high-traffic site costs in the millions of dollars a year.  Recently, I have been approached by Oracle to buy the site and all the IP associated with it. They've promised me that they'll hold it benevolently.</p>

  <p>Commerce is fine. Oracle may or may not be evil. But it doesn't belong here. Not in git-scm.com.</p>

  <p>git-scm.com is something special. It is like a library, a public park or an extremely high-end brothel. It is like a temple for the mind. <strong>A <em>temple for the mind</em>, people.</strong> It is a place we can all go to think, to learn, to share our distributed code with others. It is a unique human project, the first<em>-ish</em> of its kind in history. It is a humanitarian project to bring a free distributed source code version control system to every single person on the planet. Twice.</p>

  <p>Every single person.</p>

  <p>Twice.</p>

  <p>We're a small organization, and I've worked hard over the years to keep us lean and tight. Especially in the abdominals.</p>

  <p>To do this without resorting to advertising, we need you. It is you who keep this dream alive. It is you who have created git-scm.com. It is you who believe that a place of calm reflection, distributed source control and learning is worth having.</p>

  <p>This year, please consider making a donation to protect and sustain git-scm.com and the Git project.</p>

  <p>Thanks,<br/>
  Scott "Dragon" Chacon<br/>
  git-scm.com Maintainer</p>
