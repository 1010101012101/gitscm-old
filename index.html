<h1>Git - Fast Version Control System</h1>

<p>Git is popular version control system
designed to handle very large projects with speed and efficiency;
it is used mainly for various open source projects,
most notably the Linux kernel.</p>

<p>Git falls in the category of distributed source code management tools,
similar to e.g. GNU Arch or Monotone (or BitKeeper in the proprietary world).
Every Git working directory is a full-fledged repository with full revision
tracking capabilities, not dependent on network access or a central server.</p>

<p>Git is an <a href="http://www.opensource.org/">Open Source</a> project covered by
the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.txt">GNU General Public License</a>.
It was originally written by Linus Torvalds and is currently maintained by
Junio C Hamano.</p>

<p>Git is distributed version control system focused on
speed, effectivity and real-world usability on large projects.
Its highlights include:</p>

<!-- Heavily inspired by Wikipedia -->

<ul>

<li>
<b>Strong support for non-linear development.</b>
Git supports rapid and convenient branching and merging,
and includes powerful tools for visualizing
and navigating a non-linear development history.
</li>

<li>
<b>Distributed development.</b>
Like BitKeeper and SVK, Git gives each developer
a local copy of the entire development history,
and changes are copied from one such repository to another.
These changes are imported as additional development branches,
and can be merged in the same way as a locally developed branch.
Repositories can be easily accessed via the efficient Git protocol
(optionally wrapped in ssh) or simply using HTTP - you can publish
your repository anywhere without <em>any</em> special webserver
configuration required.
</li>

<li>
<b>Efficient handling of large projects.</b>
Git is very fast and scales well
even when working with large projects and long histories.
It is commonly an order of magnitude faster
than most other revision control systems,
and several orders of magnitude faster on some operations.
It also uses an extremely efficient packed format
for long-term revision storage
that currently tops any other open source version control system.
</li>

<li>
<b>Cryptographic authentication of history.</b>
The Git history is stored in such a way
that the name of a particular revision (a "commit" in Git terms)
depends upon the complete development history leading up to that commit.
Once it is published, it is not possible to change the old versions
without it being noticed. Also, tags can be cryptographically signed.
</li>

<li>
<b>Toolkit design.</b>
Following the Unix tradition,
Git is a collection of many small tools written in C,
and a number of scripts that provide convenient wrappers.
It is easy to chain the components together to do other clever things.
</li>

</ul>

<p>Besides providing a version control system,
the Git project provides a generic low-level toolkit
for tree history storage and directory content management.
Traditionally, the toolkit is called the <em>plumbing</em>.
Several other projects (so-called <em>porcelains</em>)
offer compatible version control interfaces - see the
<a href="#tools">related tools</a> list.</p>

<p>Some other projects have taken the concepts from the Git project
and are either porting an existing toolset to use the Git tools,
or reimplementing the concepts internally,
to benefit from the performance improvements.
This includes e.g.
<a href="http://darcs.net/DarcsWiki/DarcsGit">Darcs-git</a>.</li>

<h2 id="documentation">Git Documentation</h2>

<p>You can find all the documentation bundled with the Git source code
in the <code>Documentation/</code> subdirectory. In addition, you can
also <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/">read the web version</a>
(corresponding to the latest Git development version).</p>

<p>For a quick start, the
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/tutorial.html">tutorial</a>
covers the basics. See the
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/everyday.html">Everyday Git</a>
handbook for a useful minimum set of commands
depending on your style of Git usage.
Additionally, the
<a href="http://linux.yyz.us/git-howto.html">Kernel Hacker's Git Tutorial</a>
by Jeff Garzik may be useful.</p>

<p>For a large and continuously growing resource of information
about Git, you can refer to the <a href="http://git.or.cz/gitwiki">Git Wiki</a>
- you are welcome to contribute!</p>


<hr />

<h2 id="download">Getting Git</h2>

<p>The general download location for Git releases is
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/">http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/</a>.
You can also use one of many <a href="http://www.kernel.org/mirrors/">kernel.org mirrors</a>.</p>

<h3>Binaries</h3>

<p>For people who prefer precompiled packages, these are available:</p>

<h3>Development snapshots</h3>

<p>Daily snapshots of the main Git development branch are available at
<a href="http://www.codemonkey.org.uk/projects/git-snapshots/git/"
>http://www.codemonkey.org.uk/projects/git-snapshots/git/</a>
(thanks to Dave Jones).</p>

<h3>Git by git</h3>

<p>If you already have Git installed, you can get the latest
development version via Git itself:
<pre>git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git</pre>
</p>

<p>If you have problems connecting (Git uses port 9418),
you can try to access the repository over the HTTP protocol:
<pre>git clone http://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git</pre>
(this method is considerably slower but works even behind
firewalls and such).
</p>

<p>You can also always browse the current contents
of the git repository on web using the kernel.org
<a href="http://kernel.org/git/?p=git/git.git;a=summary">gitweb interface</a>.</p>


<hr />

<h2 id="tools">Related Tools</h2>

<p>Git is a true UNIX tool in the sense that it consists of many commands
that do one thing well. It has been designed from the start to be easily
wrapped in other tools and frontends. Currently, there are several
interfaces offering more comfortable Git usage, and also graphical
interfaces for browsing the history and more.</p>

<p>Traditionally, the low-level part of Git is called <em>plumbing</em>
and the interfaces and frontends are called <em>porcelains</em>.
Git itself comes with a default porcelain bundled and that is actually
what you will normally mean when you say you use Git. However, there
are several alternative porcelains which might offer considerably more
user friendly interface or extend Git to perform some specialied tasks.</p>

<p>There is a <strong>public Git hosting</strong> available for your
pet project, either mirroring your project or letting you push, and providing
a gitweb interface, at <a href="http://repo.or.cz/">http://repo.or.cz/</a>.</p>

<h3>Version Control Interface layers</h3>

<dl>

<dt id="cogito">Cogito</dt>
<dd>
<a href="http://git.or.cz/cogito/">Cogito</a>
is a popular version control system on top of Git.
It aims at seamless user interface and ease of use, providing
generally smoother user experience than the "raw" Git interface
and indeed also many other version control systems. However, it
also lacks many advanced capabilities of Git and is currently
being slowly phased out.</dd>

<dt id="stgit">StGIT</dt>
<dd><a href="http://www.procode.org/stgit/">Stacked Git</a> provides
a <em>Quilt</em>-like patch management functionality in the Git environment.
You can easily manage your patches in the scope of Git until they get
merged upstream.</dd>

<dt id="git-gui">Git-gui</dt>
<dd><a href="http://www.spearce.org/2007/01/git-gui-screenshots.html">git-gui</a>
is a simple Tk based graphical interface for common Git
operations. Git-gui is shipped with Git.
</dd>

</dl>

<h3>History Visualization</h3>

<dl>

<dt id="qgit">qgit</dt>
<dd><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/qgit">qgit</a> is a QT
GUI for browsing history of Git repositories, similar to <em>gitk</em>
(a simple GUI in TCL/TK distributed with stock Git)
but with more features.</dd>

<dt id="gitweb">gitweb</dt>
<dd>gitweb provides full-fledged <a href="http://www.kernel.org/git/">web interface</a>
for Git repositories. (gitweb is now part of the core Git distribution. Installation
is straightforward - take the <tt>gitweb/</tt> directory and make it accessible on the
web at a place with CGIs enabled. Then just tweak the configuration at the top of the
<tt>gitweb/gitweb.cgi</tt> script.)</dd>

</dl>
