  Initial revision

  The GIT homepage proposal.

  Yeah, this itself is in RCS since although GIT is totally cool and everything,
  I believe RCS is just fine and most convenient to use for single-file linear-history "projects".

<h1>GIT - Tree History Storage Tool</h1>

<p>GIT is a "directory content manager" designed to handle absolutely massive
projects with speed and efficiency, and the release of the 2.6.12 (and later)
versions of the Linux kernel as well as more and more other projects switching
to it would indicate that it does this task well.</p>

<p>GIT falls into the category of distributed source code management tools,
similar to Arch or Darcs (or, in the commercial world, BitKeeper).  Every GIT
working directory is a full-fledged repository with full revision tracking
capabilities, not dependent on network access to a central server.</p>

<p>Highlights:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Speed of use, both for the project maintainer, and the end-users, is a key development principle.</li>
  
	<li>Two, interchangeable, on-disk formats are used:
	<ul>
		<li>An efficient, <em>packed</em> format that saves space and network bandwidth.</li>
		<li>An <em>unpacked</em> format, optimized for fast writes and incremental work.</li>
	</ul></li>

	<li>The history is stored as a directed acyclic graph, making long-lived branches and repeated merging simple.</li>

	<li>The <em>Core GIT</em> project considers itself to provide low-level "plumbing"
	and common ground facility for other projects,
	as well as to serve to arbitrate for compatibility between them.
	The projects built on top of the core GIT are referred to as "porcelain".
	<a href="#cogito">Cogito</a>,
	<a href="#stgit">StGIT</a>,
	<a href="#hgct">(h)gct</a>,
	<a href="#gitk">gitk</a>,
	<a href="#qgit">qgit</a>,
	and
	<a href="#gitweb">gitweb</a>
	are all building upon the core GIT
	tools, and provide an easy to use interface to various pieces of
	its functionality.</li>

	<li>Some other projects have taken the concepts from the core GIT project
	and are either porting an existing toolset to use the GIT tools,
	or reimplementing the concepts internally,
	to benefit from the performance improvements.
	This includes e.g.
	<a href="http://darcs.net/DarcsWiki/DarcsGit">Darcs-git</a>.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Download</h2>

<p>To get a copy of GIT:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Daily snapshots are available at
	<a href="http://www.codemonkey.org.uk/projects/git-snapshots/git/"
	>http://www.codemonkey.org.uk/projects/git-snapshots/git/</a>
	(thanks to Dave Jones).</li>

	<li>Source tarballs and RPMs at
	<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/"
	>http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/</a>.</li>

	<li>Via <em>GIT</em> itself:
	<table border="1">
	<tr><td>Core GIT</td><td>
	<kbd>git clone http://www.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git LOCALDIR</kbd>
	</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Cogito</td><td>
	<kbd>cg-clone http://www.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git</kbd>
	</td></tr>
	<tr><td>StGIT</td><td>
	<kbd>stg clone http://www.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git LOCALDIR</kbd>
	</td></tr>
	</table>
	</li>

	<li>Alternatively, using the commands above with a
	<tt>rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git</tt> URL.
	Rsync is generally faster for the initial clone,
	and you can switch later by editing <tt>.git/branches/origin</tt>
	(or using <tt>cg-branch-chg</tt> of <em>Cogito</em>)
	and changing the URL.</li>
</ul>

<h3>SCM Interface layers</h3>

<dl>

<dt id="cogito">Cogito</dt>
<dd>
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/cogito/">Cogito</a>
is the most popular version control system on top of GIT.
It aims at seamless user interface and ease of use, providing
generally smoother user experience than the "raw" <em>Core GIT</em> itself
and indeed many other version control systems.</dd>

<dt id="stgit">StGIT</dt>
<dd><a href="http://www.procode.org/stgit/">Stacked GIT</a> provides
a <em>quilt</em>-like patch management functionality in the GIT environment.
You can easily manage your patches in the scope of GIT until they get
merged upstream.</dd>

<dt id="hgct">(h)gct</dt>
<dd><a href="http://www.cyd.liu.se/~freku045/gct/">(h)gct</a> is
a GUI enabled commit tool. It has support for both GIT and Mercurial.</dd>

<h3>History Visualization</h3>

<dl>

<dt id="gitk">gitk</dt>
<dd><a href="http://ozlabs.org/~paulus/gitk/">gitk</a> is a simple
TK GUI for browsing history of GIT repositories easily.</dd>

<dt id="qgit">qgit</dt>
<dd><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/qgit">qgit</a> is a QT
GUI for browsing history of GIT repositories, similar to <em>gitk</em>.</dd>

<dt id="gitweb">gitweb</dt>
<dd><a href="ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/gitweb/">GITweb</a>
provides full-fledged <a href="http://www.kernel.org/git/">web interface</a>
for GIT repositories.</dd>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>The GIT distribution contain a tutorial in the
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/">Documentation subdirectory</a>.
Additionally, the
<a href="http://linux.yyz.us/git-howto.html">Kernel-Hacker's GIT Tutorial</a>
may be useful.  (Thanks to Jeff Garzik for that document.)</p>


<h2>Development</h2>

<p>GIT was initially written by Linus Torvalds with help of a group of
hackers around the 'net. It is currently maintained by Junio C Hamano.</p>

<p>The GIT development takes place on the GIT mailing list.  To subscribe, send an
email with just "subscribe git" in the body to majordomo@vger.kernel.org.
Mailing list archives are available at
